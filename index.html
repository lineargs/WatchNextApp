              <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
             <p> Goran Minov built the WatchNext app as an Open Source app. This SERVICE is provided by Goran Minov at no cost and is intended for use as is.
                  </p> <p>This page is used to inform website visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and
                    disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
                  </p> <p>If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation
                    to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the

                    personally identifiable information. The information that I request is retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way

                    error in the app I collect data and information (through third party products) on your phone
                    called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address,
                    device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service,
                    the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.
                  </p> <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p> <p>Cookies are files with small amount of data that is commonly used an anonymous unique identifier. These
                    are sent to your browser from the website that you visit and are stored on your device internal memory.
                  </p> <p>This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and libraries
                    that use “cookies” to collection information and to improve their services. You have the option to either
                    accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to
                    refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.
                  </p> <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p> <p> I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:</p> <ul><li>To facilitate our Service;</li> <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li> <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li> <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li></ul> <p> I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your
                    Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they
                    are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
                  </p> <p><strong>Security</strong></p> <p> I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving
                    to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over
                    the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee
                    its absolute security.
                  </p> <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p> <p>This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed
                    to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly
                    advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over
                    and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites
                    or services.
                  </p> <p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></p> <p>These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect
                    personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case I discover that a child
                    under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from
                    our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal
                    information, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.
                  </p> <p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p> <p> I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review
                    this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting

              <h2>Terms &amp; Conditions</h2>
              <p>By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Goran Minov.</p> <p>Goran Minov is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.</p> <p>The WatchNext app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide my Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the WatchNext app won’t work properly or at all. </p> <p>You should be aware that there are certain things that Goran Minov will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Goran Minov cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.</p><p></p><p>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.</p> <p>Along the same lines, Goran Minov cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Goran Minov cannot accept responsibility</p> <p>With respect to Goran Minov’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Goran Minov accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p> <p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the requirements for the system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Goran Minov does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.</p> <p><strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong></p> <p> I may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review
                      this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting
                      the new Terms and Conditions on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on
                      this page.
