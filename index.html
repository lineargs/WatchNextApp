        </ul>

        <h4>Log Data</h4>
        <p>I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of an error in the app I collect data and
          information (through third party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include
          information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the
          configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other
          statistics.</p>

          sent to your browser from the website that you visit and are stored on your device internal memory.</p>

          that use “cookies” to collection information and to improve their services. You have the option to either
          accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse
          our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.</p>

        <h4>Service Providers</h4>
        <p>I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
          <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
          <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>

          reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or
          use the information for any other purpose.</p>

        <h4>Security</h4>
        <p>I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
          acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of
          electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

          that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review

          information from children under 13. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal
          information, I immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware
          that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do
          necessary actions.</p>

  <!-- Terms & Conditions Section -->
  <section id="terms" class="section section-alt">
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="section-title">Terms & Conditions</h2>
      <div class="legal-content">
        <p>By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
          that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of
          the app, or our trademarks in any way. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and
          other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Goran Minov.</p>
        <p>Goran Minov is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
          reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We
          will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re
          paying for.</p>
        <p>The WatchNext app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide my
          Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that
          you do not root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by
          the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious
          programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the WatchNext app won’t work
          properly or at all.</p>
        <p>You should be aware that there are certain things that Goran Minov will not take responsibility for. Certain
          functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi,
          or provided by your mobile network provider, but Goran Minov cannot take responsibility for the app not
          working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance
          left.</p>
        <p>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement
          with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider
          for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges.
          In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you
          use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you
          are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you
          have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.</p>
        <p>Along the same lines, Goran Minov cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need
          to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the
          Service, Goran Minov cannot accept responsibility.</p>
        <p>With respect to Goran Minov’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s
          important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we
          do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Goran Minov
          accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this
          functionality of the app.</p>
        <p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the requirements
          for the system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
          and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Goran Minov does not promise that
          it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you
          have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered
          to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving
          notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses
          granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your
          device.</p>

        <h4>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</h4>
        <p>I may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
          periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this
          page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>
